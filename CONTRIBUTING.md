# Contributing

Trust Assembly is a system for improving trust in news sources. For a more detailed overview of the project, see the [README](README.md).

We are currently taking contributions from members of the Trust Assembly organization. If you are interested in contributing, please reach out to us on Discord.

## Opening a Pull Request

1. Create a feature branch for your work.
   1. Branch names should be of the form `<feature>_<your_name>_<short_name>`
2. Push your branch to the repository and open a PR.
3. Request a review from a member of the Trust Assembly organization.

For commits, please try to follow the [Google Engineering guidelines](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/).

- Make [atomic commits](https://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/) that are small and focused.
- Use present tense and imperative mood in commit messages.

If the main branch has been updated while your PR is open, please rebase your branch on top of the main and fix any conflicts if they exist.

## Code review

Code review is an important part of the development process. We use GitHub's code review tools to provide feedback on pull requests. Please be responsive to feedback and be prepared to make changes to your code.

When updating your PR in response to commits, use the `fixup` git feature so it's easier for the reviewer to see what has changed. Once you have gotten approval, squash the fixup(s)
